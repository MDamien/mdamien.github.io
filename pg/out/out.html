<h1>Indy Languages</h1>
<p>There are a lot of new programming languages lately.  Jonathan Erickson calls<br/>it the "programming language renaissance."What's happening?  I think the cause is partly that computers are now so powerful<br/>that you can get decent performance without writing a native code compiler, and partly<br/>that in Web-based applications, you can use any language you want, so there is<br/>a prospect of new languages actually getting used.Maybe most important is the example of Larry Wall, who showed everyone that if<br/>you build it, they will come.<p>
